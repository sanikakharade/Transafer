## System Architecture

-  **Description:** The system architecture of the Transafer digital wallet application consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

- **Frontend (Next.js):** The frontend of the application is built using Next.js, a React framework. It provides the user interface for interacting with the application, including sign-in, sign-up, dashboard, transfer page, transactions page, and P2P transfer page.
- **Backend (Express.js):** The backend of the application is implemented using Express.js, a Node.js framework. It provides the business logic and data management for the application, including handling user authentication, processing transactions, and interacting with the database.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):** The application uses PostgreSQL as the database to store user data, transaction history, and other relevant information. PostgreSQL provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing the application's data.
- **Prisma:** Prisma is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the PostgreSQL database. It simplifies database access and management, allowing for efficient querying and data manipulation.
- **Middleware:** Middleware functions are used in Express.js to handle common tasks such as logging, error handling, and request processing. Middleware helps to streamline the application's workflow and improve its performance and reliability.
- **Dummy Endpoints:** Express.js is used to create dummy endpoints that simulate how banks add money to the digital wallet. These endpoints are used for testing and demonstration purposes only and do not interact with real banking systems.
- **Monorepo:** The application is structured as a monorepo, allowing for the management of multiple packages or modules within a single repository. This helps to organize the codebase and streamline the development process.
Overall, the system architecture of the Transafer digital wallet application is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, providing users with a seamless and reliable platform for managing their finances online.
